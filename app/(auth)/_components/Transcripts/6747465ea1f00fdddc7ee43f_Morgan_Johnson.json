When I first transitioned to working in a hospital with a larger, busier ward, I noticed my previous shoes weren\u2019t holding up to the increased walking and long shifts. The added movement and the larger area to cover meant I needed shoes with even better support and durability. That experience led me to invest in a pair that was specifically designed for high-impact, long-duration wear, which made a noticeable difference in my comfort and energy levels throughout the day."

I always make sure they're still breathable, though, for indoors. During the rainy season here in Seattle, I look for shoes with better water resistance to handle the wet weather. No matter the season, though, the core features like comfort and slip-resistance stay a priority."
