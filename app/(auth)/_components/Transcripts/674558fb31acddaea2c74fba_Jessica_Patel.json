If a brand is well-regarded, especially by fellow nurses or healthcare professionals, it gives me confidence that their shoes will meet the comfort and support needs I have for those long shifts. Positive experiences from others make me more likely to trust and try a brand, especially if they have a history of producing durable and reliable footwear. So, I do put a fair amount of weight on reputation when I\u2019m choosing work shoes."

Hearing positive experiences from fellow nurses or reading reviews from others with similar needs is pretty persuasive.

Occasionally, seeing a brand featured in a healthcare-focused magazine or at a conference can also pique my interest, especially if they highlight features that fit my needs."

It would be great if companies offered more trial periods or guarantees for their products so we can truly test if they stand up to the demands of our shifts. Also, expanding the range of styles while maintaining the functionality could bring in more options that cater to personal style preferences. Overall, prioritizing support, durability, and ease of care is key to winning us over!"
